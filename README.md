Sample Scriptable Widget to Display AdafruitIO Feed Data on an iOS home
screen or lock screen widget.  In one example a temperature value is 
displayed along with a message about how "fresh" the data is relative to 
the current time.  In a second example, the battery voltage is displayed inside a round guage indicating the battery level.

- Download the Scriptable App from the iOS App Store
- Copy and paste the JS code into a new Script
- Update the Adafruit IO username/key and feedname
- Run the script
- Edit your home or lock screen to add the widget (add the scriptable app as the widget and you'll be prompted to select the script - for the action choose "run script")
- Tip the author of Scriptable using the in-app purchase!

Also - here is a sample iOS/MacOS shortcut that will speak the Adafruit IO feed value.  Once you create this shortcut you can tap on the icon or simply ask Siri - I called my shortcut "Pool Temperature" so I can just say to my phone "Siri... Pool Temperature" and Siri will tell me the temp.
