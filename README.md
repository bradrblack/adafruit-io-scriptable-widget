Sample Scriptable Widget to Display AdafruitIO Feed Data on an iOS home
screen or lock screen widget.  In this example a temperature value is 
displayed along with a message about how "fresh" the data is relative to 
the current time.

- Download the Scriptable App from the iOS App Store
- Copy and paste this JS code into a new Script
- Update the Adafruit IO username/key and feedname
- Run the script
- Edit your home or lock screen to add the widget (add the scriptable app as the widget and you'll be prompted to select the script - for the action choose "run script")
- Tip the author of Scriptable using the in-app purchase!
